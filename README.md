## Deploy

‚ö†Ô∏è The cron job should run once a month, but will be disabled if the repo doesn't get pushed too. 

Additionally, a deployment can be triggered in the mobile app, web UI, or via the CLI  with `gh workflow run Deploy-Netlify`

## Roadmap

### Features

- **alerts for water parameters**. Use data for each species to show alert when the parameters go outside of the acceptable range for that species.
- add **plants** and water parameters for plants warnings
- add **schedule of tasks** (when to clean filter, add fertilizer, etc.)

### Improvements

  - use with tailwind breakpoints?
  - what DPI to support 1x, 2x, 3x?
- Run the bundled JS through an **minifier**

  - [Add a minifier](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/inline-js/)

- Move keys for notion data to a centralized spot (one source of truth)
- Mark current date in calendars (add [aria-current](https://css-tricks.com/making-calendars-with-accessibility-and-internationalization-in-mind/#comment-1803217))

### Someday

- Should shoelace be served locally?
